# HorseVsHumanClassifier
CNN Model to classify horse vs human using Keras

This project was created after the Deep Learning Specialization Course [https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow] on coursera.

#Steps
• Importing laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/horse-or-human.zip zipfile , unzip the data.
• Import tensorflow.
• Loading Horse and Human paths into arrays
• Constructing a sequential model using Convolution2D and MaxPooling Layers with activation function as 'relu' and for the last dense layer 'sigmoid'
• Loading Horse and Human paths into arrays
• Compliling binary crossentropy loss function and RMSProp optimizer and loss function
• Data preprocessing
• Training
• Running the model, predicting
